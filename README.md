## General info
The motivation for this project was a story about 


## Testing the Algorithm
To test my algorithm, I used Stephen King’s works and _The Fault in Our Stars_ by John Green as source bodies of texts. 
My new texts/bodies of texts were:
* _Canterbury Tales_ by Geoffrey Chaucer, 
* _The Running Man_ (a book written by Stephen King under a pseudonym), 
* a paper from the BU WR100 Journal titled _“Sylvia Plath: The Dialogue Between Poetry and Painting”_,
*_The Hunger Games_ by Suzanne Collins

In the end, the first two were more similar to Stephen King, whereas the second two resembled The Fault in Our Stars. I expected The Running Man to be similar to Stephen King’s work because it was written by him, just under a pseudonym. I also expected Canterbury Tales to be more like Stephen King’s work because it is an old piece of literature and Stephen King writes more formally than John Green. In the same way, I expected both the WR100 paper and The Hunger Games to resemble The Fault in Our Stars because they are more modern and casual in their style of writing.

Even though the algorithm is not 100% accurate and did not catch themes in the writing as much as I thought it would, it worked every time I compared a piece of work to something written by the same author. It could be more accurate if it had more elements to compare the pieces of text to make a more thorough comparison and longer texts input into the program, as it could have been more accurate because it would have had more data to choose from.
